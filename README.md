# Copilot Dev Container (VS Code Remote-SSH)

A containerized development environment for **agentic programming** with GitHub Copilot, accessed via **VS Code Remote-SSH** for full official Copilot support. Designed for secure sandboxing, Docker-in-Docker, and quick, replicatable setups.

## What is This?

This project provides a fully containerized development environment pre-configured for GitHub Copilot agentic workflows. It uses **VS Code Remote-SSH** so developers connect with their local VS Code installation—meaning full, official GitHub Copilot support (no browser workarounds). The container runs a locked-down `agent` user with Docker-in-Docker, a pre-bootstrapped shell, and a git-tracked extensions directory so the whole team shares the same VS Code setup.

- **Easy reset**: Delete the container and volume to start fresh anytime

### 🛠️ Pre-configured Tooling
- **VS Code Remote-SSH**: Full native VS Code experience with official GitHub Copilot
- **GitHub Copilot**: Full Copilot + Copilot Chat support with custom MCP servers
- **Docker-in-Docker**: Run Docker commands inside the container
- **Multi-language support**: Node.js, Python, .NET SDK 10.0 pre-installed
- **Development tools**: git, lazygit, zsh with oh-my-zsh, and more
- **Custom MCPs**: Extensible MCP configuration for enhanced agent capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- VS Code with the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension installed
- A GitHub Copilot subscription

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GIT_USERNAME=Your Name
GIT_EMAIL=your.email@example.com
```

These are **required** for git operations within the container.

Additionally, you can configure repository checkout settings in `docker-compose.yml` (optional):

```yaml
environment:
  - REPO_URL=git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/YourOrg/YourProject/YourRepo
  - REPO_FOLDER=YourRepoName
```

- `REPO_URL`: SSH URL of the Azure DevOps repository to clone on startup
- `REPO_FOLDER`: Directory name for the cloned repository (workspace root)

### 2. Start the Container

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will build the image and start the container. On first run, it automatically:
- Generates an ed25519 SSH key pair for the agent
- Sets up `authorized_keys` for Remote-SSH access
- Bootstraps the git and shell environment

### 3. Extract the SSH Private Key

Run the following to see the connection instructions printed by the container on startup:

```bash
docker logs copilot-dev-container
```

Look for the section that displays:

```
🚀 ============================================================
   VS Code Remote-SSH Connection Instructions
   ============================================================

🔐 To connect via VS Code Remote-SSH:

  1. Copy the private key from the exported file:

     📂 SSH keys exported to .ssh-keys/ directory

     See README.md for setup instructions.

  2. Add the following to your host ~/.ssh/config:

     Host copilot-dev
       HostName localhost
       Port 2222
       User agent
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/copilot-dev-container
       StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new

  3. In VS Code: F1 → 'Remote-SSH: Connect to Host' → copilot-dev
```

### 3. Copy the SSH Private Key to Your Host

The container exports the SSH private key to `.ssh-keys/copilot-dev-container` in your project directory.

**On Linux/Mac:**

```bash
cp .ssh-keys/copilot-dev-container ~/.ssh/copilot-dev-container
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/copilot-dev-container
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Copy-Item .ssh-keys\copilot-dev-container $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\copilot-dev-container
icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\copilot-dev-container" /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"
```

> **Important for Windows users**: If you see "invalid format" or "Permission denied (publickey)" errors, the most common cause is Windows line endings (CRLF) in the key file. Ensure the file uses Unix line endings (LF).

### 4. Configure SSH on Your Host

Add the following to your SSH config file:

**Linux/Mac** (`~/.ssh/config`):
```
Host copilot-dev
  HostName localhost
  Port 2222
  User agent
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/copilot-dev-container
  StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
```

**Windows** (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\config`):
```
Host copilot-dev
  HostName localhost
  Port 2222
  User agent
  IdentityFile C:/Users/<YourUsername>/.ssh/copilot-dev-container
  StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
```

> **Note for Windows**: Use forward slashes (/) in the `IdentityFile` path, even on Windows. Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual Windows username.

### 5. Configure VS Code Remote-SSH Settings

Before connecting for the first time, open VS Code Settings (**File → Preferences → Settings** or **Cmd/Ctrl+,**) and set:

```json
"remote.SSH.localServerDownload": "always"
```

This tells VS Code to download its server component locally and copy it to the container via SCP, rather than trying to download it from inside the container. This is the recommended approach and avoids network issues inside the container.

> **Why?** VS Code Remote-SSH needs to install a ~100 MB "VS Code Server" binary on the remote machine on first connection. With `localServerDownload: "always"` VS Code downloads the binary on your host machine and copies it to the container via SSH. Without this setting VS Code tries to download the server from inside the container, which can fail if the container's outbound internet access is limited.

### 6. Connect via VS Code Remote-SSH

1. Open VS Code
2. Press **F1** (or **Ctrl+Shift+P**)
3. Type **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host**
4. Select **copilot-dev**

VS Code will open a new window connected to the dev environment. The default workspace is at `/home/agent/workspace`.

On first connection VS Code will show **"Setting up SSH Host copilot-dev: Copying VS Code Server to host with scp"**. This copies ~100 MB over SSH and may take 30–60 seconds depending on your network speed. Subsequent connections are instant because the server is cached in the container's volume.

> **Tip**: To view detailed progress during first connection, press **Ctrl+Shift+U** (or **Cmd+Shift+U** on Mac) to open the Output panel, then select **"Remote - SSH"** from the dropdown menu.

### 7. Add Git SSH Key

The container exports your **public** SSH key to `.ssh-keys/copilot-dev-container.pub`. View this file and add it to your git hosting service (GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab, etc.) to enable authenticated git operations over SSH from within the container.

**To view your public key:**
```bash
cat .ssh-keys/copilot-dev-container.pub
```

## Working with Azure DevOps Work Items

This container includes the `start-issue` command for streamlined issue-based development workflows with Azure DevOps integration.

### The `start-issue` Command

The `start-issue` command automates the entire workflow of starting work on an Azure DevOps work item:

1. **Fetches work item details** from Azure DevOps (title, description, acceptance criteria)
2. **Generates deterministic branch names** based on issue number and title (e.g., `1234-fix-login-bug`)
3. **Interactive repository selection** - prompts you to select which repos you want to actively work on
4. **Branch management** - creates work branches for selected repos, scratchpad branches for others
5. **Auto-spin up GitHub Copilot agent** in yolo mode, primed to work on the issue

### Usage

```bash
start-issue <issue-number> [--agent <agent-name>]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Start work on issue #1234 with default agent
start-issue 1234

# Start work on issue #1234 with custom agent name
start-issue 1234 --agent my-custom-agent
```

### What Happens When You Run It

1. **Authentication Check**: Verifies you're logged into Azure CLI (prompts if not)
2. **Fetch Work Item**: Retrieves issue details from Azure DevOps
3. **Branch Name Generation**: Creates a deterministic, readable branch name (max 24 chars)
4. **Repository Selection**: If on main branch, prompts which repos to work on (using `gum` for UI)
5. **Git Operations**: 
   - Selected repos → Creates/checks out work branch (e.g., `1234-fix-login-bug`)
   - Other repos → Creates/checks out scratchpad branch (e.g., `scratchpad/1234`)
6. **Draft Pull Request Creation**: For newly created work branches, automatically creates draft PRs with title format `#1234 - Issue Title`
7. **Agent Launch**: Spins up GitHub Copilot agent with prompt: "Commence work on azure devops work item 1234"

### Safety Features

- **Uncommitted changes check**: Won't switch branches if you have uncommitted work
- **Branch conflict detection**: Warns if you're on another issue's branch
- **Scratchpad isolation**: Non-selected repos get isolated scratchpad branches
- **Safe git push**: `git_push` command blocks scratchpad branches and checks for uncommitted changes

## Configuration Files

### `vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json` - VS Code Remote Settings

Controls VS Code editor settings applied on the remote container. Mounted (as part of the full `./vscode-server` bind-mount) at `/home/agent/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json`.

Default settings include:
- GitHub Copilot enabled
- Inline suggestions enabled
- zsh as default terminal
- Abyss color theme
- Copilot Chat agent mode enabled

### `vscode-server/data/User/mcp.json` - MCP Server Configuration

Configures Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that extend GitHub Copilot's capabilities in VS Code. Mounted at `/home/agent/.vscode-server/data/User/mcp.json`.

### `commands.json` - CLI MCP Mapper Commands

Defines custom commands available to the agent through the [cli-mcp-mapper](https://github.com/SteffenBlake/cli-mcp-mapper) MCP server. Mounted at `/home/agent/.config/cli-mcp-mapper/commands.json`.

The default configuration includes commands for:
- **.NET operations**: build, restore, test, format
- **Git operations**: status, diff, branch, stage, unstage, restore, commit (with issue tracking), push (safeguarded)
- **Azure DevOps**: get work items, list PRs, get PR comments, list allowed repos
- **File system operations**: ls, mv, mkdir, rm, grep, sed, wc

**Git commit behavior**: The `git_commit` command automatically formats commits as `[#<issue>][Copilot] <message>` and attributes them to `<GIT_USERNAME>+copilot` for agent identification.

**Git push safety**: The `git_push` command includes safety checks:
- Blocks pushing scratchpad branches
- Checks for uncommitted changes before pushing
- Prevents accidental pushes of unfinished work

**Draft PR automation**: When `start-issue` creates a new work branch (not scratchpad), it automatically creates a draft pull request in Azure DevOps. The PR title follows the format `#<issue> - <title>`. Draft PRs are only created once when the branch is initially created, using branch creation as a semaphore to prevent duplicate PRs.

**To configure custom commands**, see the [cli-mcp-mapper documentation](https://github.com/SteffenBlake/cli-mcp-mapper) for detailed information on command structure and parameters.

### `repo-mappings.json` - Repository Configuration

Defines the workspace repository structure and main branch names for multi-repo projects. This file is used by the `start-issue` command to manage branches across multiple repositories (e.g., monorepo with submodules).

**Location**: Mounted at `/etc/repo-mappings.json` (read-only)

**Example structure**:
```json
{
  "repoMainBranches": {
    ".": "main",
    "./Services": "develop",
    "./Mobile": "develop",
    "./DataHub": "main"
  }
}
```

- **Keys**: Relative paths to repositories (`.` = workspace root, `./Services` = submodule)
- **Values**: The main/default branch name for each repository

The `start-issue` command uses this to:
- Know which repositories exist in your workspace
- Understand what the "main" branch is for each repo (for creating feature branches from)
- Manage branch creation across all configured repositories

**To add a repository**: Add a new entry with the relative path and its main branch name.

### `allowed-repositories.conf` - Azure DevOps Repository Whitelist

Defines which Azure DevOps repositories agents are allowed to access through Azure CLI commands. This is a security measure to restrict agent access.

**Location**: Mounted at `/etc/allowed-repositories.conf` (read-only)

**Format**: One repository name per line, comments start with `#`

**Example**:
```conf
# Azure DevOps Repositories that agents are allowed to access
# One repository name per line
# Lines starting with # are ignored
Aspire
Services
Mobile
DataHub
```

Agents can only interact with Azure DevOps repositories listed in this file. Commands like `az_devops_get_pull_requests` will validate repository parameters against this whitelist.

**To allow additional repositories**: Add the repository name on a new line.

**Security note**: Repository names are validated to contain only alphanumeric characters, dots, dashes, and underscores to prevent injection attacks.

## Azure DevOps Integration

The container includes Azure CLI with the Azure DevOps extension pre-installed, locked down for agent safety:

### Locked Configuration

The following are **locked at build time** in the Dockerfile and cannot be changed by agents:
- **Organization**: Set via `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG` environment variable
- **Project**: Set via `AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT` environment variable

These ensure agents can only operate within your designated Azure DevOps organization and project.

### Agent Commands

Agents have access to these Azure DevOps commands (via `cli-mcp-mapper`):

- **`az_devops_get_work_item`**: Fetch work item details (description, acceptance criteria)
- **`az_devops_get_pull_requests`**: List open PRs for a repository
- **`az_devops_get_pr_comments`**: Get comment threads on a PR
- **`az_devops_list_repos`**: List allowed repositories

All commands automatically use the locked organization and project. Repository parameters are validated against the `allowed-repositories.conf` whitelist.

## Architecture

### Container Structure

- **Base Image**: Debian 13
- **Init System**: s6-overlay (manages sshd, dockerd, bootstrap services)
- **SSH Server**: OpenSSH on port 2222 (key-based auth only, agent user only)
- **User**: Locked-down `agent` user with docker group access
- **Workspace**: `/home/agent/workspace`
- **Persistent Storage**: `/home/agent` persisted in a Docker named volume

### s6-overlay Services

| Service | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `agent-bootstrap` | oneshot | Validates env, generates SSH keys, configures git |
| `sshd` | longrun | OpenSSH server on port 2222 |
| `dockerd` | longrun | Docker daemon (Docker-in-Docker) |

### Security Features

- **Non-root user**: All development operations run as the `agent` user
- **Key-based SSH only**: Password authentication disabled
- **Agent-only SSH access**: `AllowUsers agent` in sshd_config
- **No root SSH login**: `PermitRootLogin no`
- **Isolated credentials**: GPG and pass configured for secure credential storage
- **Home directory permissions**: Locked down to 700

### Installed Tools

- **Languages**: Node.js, Python 3, .NET SDK 10.0, .NET Aspire CLI
- **Version Control**: git, lazygit
- **Azure Tools**: Azure CLI with Azure DevOps extension
- **UI Tools**: gum (interactive CLI prompts)
- **Security**: GPG, pass (password manager), OpenSSH
- **Shell**: zsh with oh-my-zsh (jonathan theme)
- **AI Tools**: cli-mcp-mapper
- **Docker**: Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin
- **Custom Commands**: `start-issue` (Azure DevOps workflow automation)

## Common Tasks

### Start Work on an Issue

1. Connect to the container via VS Code Remote-SSH (see Quick Start above)
2. Open a terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl+` `` or `View > Terminal`)
3. Run the start-issue command:

```bash
start-issue 1234

# Or with custom agent name
start-issue 1234 --agent my-agent
```

The command will automatically prompt for Azure CLI authentication if needed.

### View Container Logs

```bash
docker logs copilot-dev-container
```

### Restart the Container

```bash
docker compose restart
```

### Stop the Container

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Rebuild After Configuration Changes

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Access Container Shell Directly

```bash
docker exec -it copilot-dev-container zsh
```

### Reset Everything (Fresh Start)

```bash
docker compose down -v  # Warning: Deletes all container data!
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Persistent Data

Agent home (`/home/agent`) is stored in a Docker named volume (`agent-home`), which persists between container restarts. This includes workspace files, shell history, SSH keys, and git credentials.

The entire `./vscode-server/` directory is bind-mounted at `/home/agent/.vscode-server/`. This means VS Code server state, settings, MCP configuration, and extensions are all stored on the host and tracked in this git repo.

To completely reset the environment, remove the volume with `docker compose down -v` (your committed `vscode-server/` content is unaffected, being in the repo, not the volume).

## Port Configuration

| Port | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **2222** | SSH (VS Code Remote-SSH connection) |
| **17275** | GitHub Copilot authentication callback |
| **65432** | cli-mcp-mapper MCP server |

To use a different SSH port, modify the `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml` and update your `~/.ssh/config` accordingly.

## Customization

### Installing Additional Tools

Edit the `Dockerfile` to add more tools:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    your-package-here \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Changing the Shell Theme

Modify the `ZSH_THEME` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - ZSH_THEME=robbyrussell  # or any oh-my-zsh theme
```

### Adding VS Code Extensions

Extensions are managed via the **git-tracked `vscode-server/extensions/` directory** in this repo, which is part of the `./vscode-server` bind-mount at `~/.vscode-server/`.

**Workflow:**

1. Connect to the container via VS Code Remote-SSH
2. Install extensions normally through the VS Code Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Back on your host machine, the installed extensions appear in `./vscode-server/extensions/`
4. Commit the directory to share extensions with the team:

```bash
git add vscode-server/extensions/
git commit -m "Add VS Code extensions: github.copilot, ..."
git push
```

When a team member clones the repo and starts the container, VS Code finds the extensions pre-installed in the bind-mounted directory — no manual install needed.

### Configuring Azure DevOps

To change the Azure DevOps organization or project, edit the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Set Azure DevOps configuration (locked at build time)
ENV AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=YourOrgName
ENV AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT=YourProjectName
```

Then rebuild: `docker compose up -d --build`

**Important**: These values are intentionally locked at build time for security. Agents cannot modify them at runtime.

### Managing Repository Access

**To add allowed repositories**, edit `allowed-repositories.conf`:
```conf
YourNewRepo
AnotherRepo
```

**To configure workspace repositories**, edit `repo-mappings.json`:
```json
{
  "repoMainBranches": {
    ".": "main",
    "./YourSubmodule": "develop"
  }
}
```

Both files require a container rebuild to take effect: `docker compose up -d --build`

## Troubleshooting

### Container Fails to Start

Check logs for missing environment variables:

```bash
docker logs copilot-dev-container
```

Ensure your `.env` file has `GIT_USERNAME` and `GIT_EMAIL` set.

### "invalid format" or "Permission denied (publickey)" on Windows

**Problem**: When connecting from Windows, you see errors like:
```
Load key "C:\\Users\\username/.ssh/copilot-dev-container": invalid format
agent@localhost: Permission denied (publickey).
```

**Cause**: The SSH private key file has Windows line endings (CRLF) instead of Unix line endings (LF). OpenSSH on Windows requires Unix line endings for private key files.

**Solution**:

1. Open the key file (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\copilot-dev-container`) in VS Code
2. Look at the bottom-right corner of VS Code - you'll see either `CRLF` or `LF`
3. If it says `CRLF`, click it and select `LF` from the menu
4. Save the file (Ctrl+S)
5. Try connecting again

**Verify the fix**:
```powershell
# Check if the file has Unix line endings (should show "LF")
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\copilot-dev-container -Raw | Select-String "`r`n"
# If this returns matches, the file still has Windows line endings - fix it!
```

### "Copying VS Code Server" Spinner Hangs Forever

This means `remote.SSH.localServerDownload` is not set to `"always"`, or the VS Code Server download is not being found. Follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code Settings (**Cmd/Ctrl+,**) and search for `remote.SSH.localServerDownload`
2. Set it to **"always"** (not "off" or "auto")
3. Reconnect — VS Code will download the server locally and copy it via SCP

If it still hangs after setting `localServerDownload: "always"`, the SCP copy itself is likely timing out. Try connecting from a faster network or check for MTU issues between your machine and the container host.

### "VS Code Server Could Not Be Downloaded" Error

This means VS Code is trying to download the server from inside the container, and the container can't reach the VS Code CDN. Fix:

Set `remote.SSH.localServerDownload: "always"` in VS Code Settings — this makes VS Code download the server on your local machine and copy it over SSH instead.

### Can't Connect via Remote-SSH

1. Ensure the container is running: `docker ps`
2. Check that the SSH key has correct permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/copilot-dev-container`
3. Verify SSH config entry in `~/.ssh/config`
4. Test SSH connectivity: `ssh copilot-dev`
5. Check container SSH logs: `docker logs copilot-dev-container`

### Repository Clone Takes Too Long

The container startup includes cloning your repository with all submodules (if configured via `REPO_URL` and `REPO_FOLDER`). For large repositories, this can take several minutes.

**Symptoms**:
- Container logs show "Cloning into..." messages but no progress
- s6 timeout errors: "s6-rc: fatal: timed out" or "s6-sudoc: fatal: unable to get exit status from server: Operation timed out"

**Solution**:
The `S6_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES_MAXTIME` setting in the Dockerfile controls the global timeout (default: 30000ms = 30 seconds). For large repositories with submodules, you may need to increase this value in the Dockerfile and rebuild:

```dockerfile
ENV S6_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES_MAXTIME=600000  # 10 minutes
```

You may also need to increase the service-specific timeout in `s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/agent-bootstrap/timeout-up` to match.

**Note**: The `--progress` flag on git clone provides feedback during long operations, showing percentage and transfer speed.

### SSH Warnings During Clone

**"Warning: Permanently added 'ssh.dev.azure.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts"**

This warning appears during the initial git clone when SSH connects to Azure DevOps for the first time. With `--recurse-submodules`, each submodule creates a separate SSH connection, so you might see this warning multiple times (once per repository).

**Why it happens**:
- SSH adds the host to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` on first connection
- Each submodule clone is a separate SSH connection
- The warning is informational and harmless

**Suppression**:
The SSH config includes `LogLevel ERROR` to suppress these informational warnings. If you still see them, it's normal for the first container startup and won't appear on subsequent runs.

### Can't Push to Git Repositories

1. Ensure you've added the container's public SSH key to your git host
2. Check the public key: `cat .ssh-keys/copilot-dev-container.pub`
3. Verify git configuration: From VS Code terminal run `git config --list`
4. Test git SSH: `ssh -T git@github.com` (from inside container)

### start-issue Command Fails

**"Repository path does not exist"**:
- Verify `REPO_URL` and `REPO_FOLDER` are set correctly in `docker-compose.yml`
- Ensure the repository was cloned successfully on container start (check logs)
- Confirm all submodules are initialized: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

**"Not logged in to Azure CLI"**:
- The `start-issue` command will automatically prompt for Azure authentication when needed
- Follow the interactive browser login flow

**"Repository not in allowed list"**:
- Check that the repository name exists in `allowed-repositories.conf`
- Repository names are case-sensitive

**"Config file not found"**:
- Verify `repo-mappings.json` is properly mounted in `docker-compose.yml`
- Ensure the file exists and contains valid JSON
- Check that root repository "." is defined in the mappings

### Azure DevOps Commands Don't Work

1. Verify Azure CLI is logged in: From VS Code terminal run `az account show`
2. Check organization/project settings in the Dockerfile match your Azure DevOps setup
3. Ensure you have permissions to access the work items/repositories
4. Confirm repository names in `allowed-repositories.conf` match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Port 2222 Already in Use

Change the host port in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "2223:2222"  # Use port 2223 instead
```

Update your `~/.ssh/config` to match:

```
Host copilot-dev
  Port 2223
```
